# PythonCodePractice

Hello! I'm an aspiring data engineer studying at Zip Code Wilmington. This is my public repo where I try to complete 5-10 questions on LeetCode to practice my Python and SQL skills. I thought it'd be cool to track my progress and have a time line of how I improved and kept going at it to become a better programmer!
